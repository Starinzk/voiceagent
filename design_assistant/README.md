# Design Assistant

A design workflow system with three agents: Design Coach, Design Strategist, and Design Evaluator.

## Test Suite

The test suite (`test_design_workflow.py`) verifies the functionality of the design workflow system. All tests are passing as of the latest run.

### Test Coverage

1. **Design Coach Agent Tests**
   - ✅ `test_identify_customer_success`: Verifies successful customer identification
   - ✅ `test_identify_customer_database_error`: Verifies error handling during customer identification
   - ✅ `test_capture_design_challenge_success`: Verifies successful design challenge capture
   - ✅ `test_capture_design_challenge_no_user`: Verifies handling of unauthenticated users
   - ✅ `test_capture_design_challenge_timeout`: Verifies timeout handling during challenge capture

2. **Design Strategist Agent Tests**
   - ✅ `test_refine_problem_statement_success`: Verifies successful problem statement refinement
   - ✅ `test_refine_problem_statement_invalid_format`: Verifies format validation for problem statements
   - ✅ `test_propose_solution_success`: Verifies successful solution proposal
   - ✅ `test_propose_solution_no_problem_statement`: Verifies handling of missing problem statements

3. **Integration Tests**
   - ✅ `test_complete_workflow`: Verifies the complete design workflow from start to finish

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd design_assistant
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest test_design_workflow.py -v
   ```

### Test Results

Latest test run results:
```
10 passed, 1 warning in 2.21s
```

Note: There is one non-critical warning about the event loop that does not affect test results.

### Future Test Improvements

1. Add integration tests with real LiveKit components
2. Add performance tests
3. Add stress tests
4. Add more edge cases
5. Add database state verification
6. Add concurrent operation tests

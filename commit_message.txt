feat: Revert to stable multi-agent workflow

Reverts the experimental session-loading feature to restore the application to a known-good state.

- Removes all session-loading logic from the codebase and prompts.
- Simplifies the DesignCoachAgent to a two-step process: identify user, then capture design challenge.
- Stabilizes the agent tool architecture by ensuring all tools on a given agent have compatible return types, resolving the underlying framework conflicts.

This commit establishes a stable foundation for correctly speccing and re-implementing session persistence as a new feature.
